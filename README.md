# Python CodeClub Challenges and Solutions

Here you will find challenges and solutions that were done on some
Python CodeClub meetups.

Idea of this repo is to show several different solutions to the same problem.

Sub optimal and somewhat broken solutions also welcome! We can help improve them. :)
